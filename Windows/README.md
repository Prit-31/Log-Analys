# üìÇ log-analys

A **professional SOC log repository** for Blue Team analysts, threat hunters, and cybersecurity learners.

This repo contains **realistic Windows event logs**, organized to help you:
- Understand Windows Security Event IDs
- Build detection rules in SIEM tools (Splunk, Sentinel, ELK)
- Practice threat hunting
- Study real-world attacker tactics mapped to MITRE ATT&CK

## üìö What I Learned

‚úÖ **Windows Event ID Mastery**
- Deep understanding of common Windows Security Event IDs: 4624, 4625, 4768, 4769, 4771, 4720, 4722, 4723, 4724, 4728, 4688, 4672, 4673, 4674, 4698, 7045, 4657, 5140, 5156.
- Analyzed how each log‚Äôs fields (Logon Type, Authentication Package, Source IP, Process, Command Line) reveal attacker behavior.

‚úÖ **Attack Chains & Detection**
- Mapped event chains: brute force (4625 ‚Üí 4624), Kerberos abuse (4768/4769/4771), lateral movement (RDP, PsExec, WMI), persistence (scheduled tasks, services, registry keys), privilege escalation (4672 ‚Üí 4673 ‚Üí 4674).
- Learned how attackers link events to pivot deeper into a network.
- Built example detections: repeated failed logons, unusual admin logins, suspicious PowerShell encoded commands.

‚úÖ **Real Attacker Tactics**
- Studied Golden Ticket, Silver Ticket, Pass-the-Ticket, Kerberoasting.
- Learned edge cases (forged TGT/TGS) and why basic IP checks fail.
- Learned practical SOC defense strategies: detection, correlation, blocking, automation logic.

‚úÖ **Defensive Playbooks**
- Designed sample Python logic to auto-detect brute force by tracking multiple 4625 events from same IP.
- Planned blocking suspicious admin logons by cross-checking usernames, IP ranges, and logon types.
- Combined manual SOC investigation with automation (firewall block + account disable).

‚úÖ **Professional Logging Repo**
- Structured logs in folders by tactic: authentication, privilege escalation, persistence, lateral movement, network access, process execution, account manipulation, kerberos-attacks.
- Wrote clear, realistic JSON examples to help any SOC analyst understand and practice detection.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How To Use

1. Study the logs to understand each attack.
2. Simulate scenarios in a lab SIEM (Splunk, Sentinel, ELK).
3. Build detection queries and automation playbooks.
4. Share with teammates to practice SOC workflows.
